# 七章 

## 二 对待别人的原则，两种门，警告假先知

太7:12-20

***

7:12 所以，无论何事，你们愿意人怎样待你们，你们也要怎样待人，因为这就是律法和先知的道理。」<br>
7:13 「你们要进窄门。因为引到灭亡，那门是宽的，路是大的，进去的人也多；<br>
7:14 引到永生，那门是窄的，路是小的，找着的人也少。」<br>
7:15 「你们要防备假先知。他们到你们这里来，外面披着羊皮，里面却是残暴的狼。<br>
7:16 凭着他们的果子，就可以认出他们来。荆棘上岂能摘葡萄呢？蒺藜里岂能摘无花果呢？<br>
7:17 这样，凡好树都结好果子，惟独坏树结坏果子。<br>
7:18 好树不能结坏果子；坏树不能结好果子。<br>
7:19 凡不结好果子的树就砍下来，丢在火里。<br>
7:20 所以，凭着他们的果子就可以认出他们来。」<br>

***

12 "So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. 13 "Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. 14 For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. 15 "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. 16 You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 17 So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. 18 A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.
