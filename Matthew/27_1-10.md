# 二十七章 

## 一 加略人犹大的结局

太27:1-10

***

27:1 到了早晨，众祭司长和民间的长老大家商议要治死耶稣，<br>
27:2 就把他捆绑，解去，交给巡抚彼拉多。<br>
27:3 这时候，卖耶稣的犹大看见耶稣已经定了罪，就后悔，把那三十块钱拿回来给祭司长和长老，说：<br>
27:4 「我卖了无辜之人的血是有罪了。」他们说：「那与我们有什么相干？你自己承当吧！」<br>
27:5 犹大就把那银钱丢在殿里，出去吊死了。<br>
27:6 祭司长拾起银钱来，说：「这是血价，不可放在库里。」<br>
27:7 他们商议，就用那银钱买了窑户的一块田，为要埋葬外乡人。<br>
27:8 所以那块田直到今日还叫做「血田」。<br>
27:9 这就应了先知耶利米的话，说：「他们用那三十块钱，就是被估定之人的价钱，是以色列人中所估定的，<br>
27:10 买了窑户的一块田；这是照着主所吩咐我的。」<br>

***

1 When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. 2 And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.
Judas Hangs Himself
3 Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, 4 saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." They said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself." 5 And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. 6 But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money." 7 So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers. 8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. 9 Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, 10 and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."
