# 十章 

## 一 差遣第一批基督徒传道人

太10:1-15

***

10:1 耶稣叫了十二个门徒来，给他们权柄，能赶逐污鬼，并医治各样的病症。<br>
10:2 这十二使徒的名：头一个叫西门（又称彼得），还有他兄弟安得烈，西庇太的儿子雅各和雅各的兄弟约翰，<br>
10:3 腓力和巴多罗买，多马和税吏马太，亚勒腓的儿子雅各，和达太，<br>
10:4 奋锐党的西门，还有卖耶稣的加略人犹大。<br>
10:5 耶稣差这十二个人去，吩咐他们说：「外邦人的路，你们不要走；撒马利亚人的城，你们不要进；<br>
10:6 宁可往以色列家迷失的羊那里去。<br>
10:7 随走随传，说『天国近了！』<br>
10:8 医治病人，叫死人复活，叫长大麻风的洁净，把鬼赶出去。你们白白地得来，也要白白地舍去。<br>
10:9 腰袋里不要带金银铜钱；<br>
10:10 行路不要带口袋；不要带两件褂子，也不要带鞋和拐杖。因为工人得饮食是应当的。<br>
10:11 你们无论进哪一城，哪一村，要打听那里谁是好人，就住在他家，直住到走的时候。<br>
10:12 进他家里去，要请他的安。<br>
10:13 那家若配得平安，你们所求的平安就必临到那家；若不配得，你们所求的平安仍归你们。<br>
10:14 凡不接待你们、不听你们话的人，你们离开那家，或是那城的时候，就把脚上的尘土跺下去。<br>
10:15 我实在告诉你们，当审判的日子，所多玛和蛾摩拉所受的，比那城还容易受呢！」<br>

1 And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction. 2 The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; 3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 4 Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. 5 These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, "Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, 6 but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 7 And proclaim as you go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' 8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay. 9 Acquire no gold nor silver nor copper for your belts, 10 no bag for your journey, nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff, for the laborer deserves his food. 11 And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you depart. 12 As you enter the house, greet it. 13 And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. 14 And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town. 15 Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.
