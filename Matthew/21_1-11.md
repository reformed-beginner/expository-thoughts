# 二十一章 

## 一 基督公开进入耶路撒冷

太21:1-11

***

21:1 耶稣和门徒将近耶路撒冷，到了伯法其，在橄榄山那里。<br>
21:2 耶稣就打发两个门徒，对他们说：「你们往对面村子里去，必看见一匹驴拴在那里，还有驴驹同在一处；你们解开，牵到我这里来。<br>
21:3 若有人对你们说什么，你们就说：『主要用它。』那人必立时让你们牵来。<br>
21:4 这事成就是要应验先知的话，说：<br>
21:5 要对锡安的居民说：看哪，你的王来到你这里，是温柔的，又骑着驴，就是骑着驴驹子。」<br>
21:6 门徒就照耶稣所吩咐的去行，<br>
21:7 牵了驴和驴驹来，把自己的衣服搭在上面，耶稣就骑上。<br>
21:8 众人多半把衣服铺在路上；还有人砍下树枝来铺在路上。<br>
21:9 前行后随的众人喊着说：和散那归于大卫的子孙！奉主名来的是应当称颂的！高高在上和散那！<br>
21:10 耶稣既进了耶路撒冷，合城都惊动了，说：「这是谁？」<br>
21:11 众人说：「这是加利利拿撒勒的先知耶稣。」<br>

***

1 Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 2 saying to them, "Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. 3 If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and he will send them at once." 4 This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying, 5 "Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.'" 6 The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. 7 They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them. 8 Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. 9 And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!" 10 And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, "Who is this?" 11 And the crowds said, "This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee."
