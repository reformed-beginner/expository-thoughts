# 二十六章 

## 一 用香膏浇耶稣头的妇人

太26:1-13

***

26:1 耶稣说完了这一切的话，就对门徒说：<br>
26:2 「你们知道，过两天是逾越节，人子将要被交给人，钉在十字架上。」<br>
26:3 那时，祭司长和民间的长老聚集在大祭司称为该亚法的院里。<br>
26:4 大家商议要用诡计拿住耶稣，杀他，<br>
26:5 只是说：「当节的日子不可，恐怕民间生乱。」<br>
26:6 耶稣在伯大尼长大麻风的西门家里，<br>
26:7 有一个女人拿着一玉瓶极贵的香膏来，趁耶稣坐席的时候，浇在他的头上。<br>
26:8 门徒看见就很不喜悦，说：「何用这样的枉费呢！<br>
26:9 这香膏可以卖许多钱，周济穷人。」<br>
26:10 耶稣看出他们的意思，就说：「为什么难为这女人呢？她在我身上做的是一件美事。<br>
26:11 因为常有穷人和你们同在；只是你们不常有我。<br>
26:12 她将这香膏浇在我身上是为我安葬做的。<br>
26:13 我实在告诉你们，普天之下，无论在什么地方传这福音，也要述说这女人所行的，作个纪念。」<br>

***

1 When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, 2 "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified." 3 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, 4 and plotted together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. 5 But they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people." 6 Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, 7 a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table. 8 And when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste? 9 For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor." 10 But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. 11 For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. 12 In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial. 13 Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her."
