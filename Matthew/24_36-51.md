# 二十四章 

## 四 基督再临之前的描述，嘱咐警醒

太24:36-51

***

24:36 「但那日子，那时辰，没有人知道，连天上的使者也不知道，子也不知道，惟独父知道。<br>
24:37 挪亚的日子怎样，人子降临也要怎样。<br>
24:38 当洪水以前的日子，人照常吃喝嫁娶，直到挪亚进方舟的那日；<br>
24:39 不知不觉洪水来了，把他们全都冲去。人子降临也要这样。<br>
24:40 那时，两个人在田里，取去一个，撇下一个。<br>
24:41 两个女人推磨，取去一个，撇下一个。<br>
24:42 所以，你们要警醒，因为不知道你们的主是哪一天来到。<br>
24:43 家主若知道几更天有贼来，就必警醒，不容人挖透房屋；这是你们所知道的。<br>
24:44 所以，你们也要预备，因为你们想不到的时候，人子就来了。」<br>
24:45 「谁是忠心有见识的仆人，为主人所派，管理家里的人，按时分粮给他们呢？<br>
24:46 主人来到，看见他这样行，那仆人就有福了。<br>
24:47 我实在告诉你们，主人要派他管理一切所有的。<br>
24:48 倘若那恶仆心里说：『我的主人必来得迟』，<br>
24:49 就动手打他的同伴，又和酒醉的人一同吃喝。<br>
24:50 在想不到的日子，不知道的时辰，那仆人的主人要来，<br>
24:51 重重地处治他，定他和假冒为善的人同罪；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。」<br>

36 "But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son,but the Father only. 37 For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, 39 and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 40 Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. 41 Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. 42 Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. 44 Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. 45 "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? 46 Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. 47 Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. 48 But if that wicked servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed,' 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards, 50 the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know 51 and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
