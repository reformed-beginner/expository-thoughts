## 五 假使徒的亲嘴，基督自愿的顺服

太26:47-56

***

26:47 说话之间，那十二个门徒里的犹大来了，并有许多人带着刀棒，从祭司长和民间的长老那里与他同来。<br>
26:48 那卖耶稣的给了他们一个暗号，说：「我与谁亲嘴，谁就是他。你们可以拿住他。」<br>
26:49 犹大随即到耶稣跟前，说：「请拉比安」，就与他亲嘴。<br>
26:50 耶稣对他说：「朋友，你来要做的事，就做吧。」于是那些人上前，下手拿住耶稣。<br>
26:51 有跟随耶稣的一个人伸手拔出刀来，将大祭司的仆人砍了一刀，削掉了他一个耳朵。<br>
26:52 耶稣对他说：「收刀入鞘吧！凡动刀的，必死在刀下。<br>
26:53 你想，我不能求我父现在为我差遣十二营多天使来吗？<br>
26:54 若是这样，经上所说，事情必须如此的话怎么应验呢？」<br>
26:55 当时，耶稣对众人说：「你们带着刀棒出来拿我，如同拿强盗吗？我天天坐在殿里教训人，你们并没有拿我。<br>
26:56 但这一切的事成就了，为要应验先知书上的话。」当下，门徒都离开他，逃走了。<br>

***

47 While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. 48 Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I will kiss is the man; seize him." 49 And he came up to Jesus at once and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" And he kissed him. 50 Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you came to do." Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. 51 And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword. 53 Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? 54 But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?" 55 At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. 56 But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled.
