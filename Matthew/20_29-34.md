## 四 基督治好两个瞎眼的人

太20:29-34

***

20:29 他们出耶利哥的时候，有极多的人跟随他。<br>
20:30 有两个瞎子坐在路旁，听说是耶稣经过，就喊着说：「主啊，大卫的子孙，可怜我们吧！」<br>
20:31 众人责备他们，不许他们作声；他们却越发喊着说：「主啊，大卫的子孙，可怜我们吧！」<br>
20:32 耶稣就站住，叫他们来，说：「要我为你们做什么？」<br>
20:33 他们说：「主啊，要我们的眼睛能看见！」<br>
20:34 耶稣就动了慈心，把他们的眼睛一摸，他们立刻看见，就跟从了耶稣。<br>

***

29 And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. 30 And behold, there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!" 31 The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!" 32 And stopping, Jesus called them and said, "What do you want me to do for you?" 33 They said to him, "Lord, let our eyes be opened." 34 And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight and followed him.
