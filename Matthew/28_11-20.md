## 四 基督行医治的神迹

太28:11-20

***

28:11 她们去的时候，看守的兵有几个进城去，将所经历的事都报给祭司长。<br>
28:12 祭司长和长老聚集商议，就拿许多银钱给兵丁，说：<br>
28:13 「你们要这样说：『夜间我们睡觉的时候，他的门徒来，把他偷去了。』<br>
28:14 倘若这话被巡抚听见，有我们劝他，保你们无事。」<br>
28:15 兵丁受了银钱，就照所嘱咐他们的去行。这话就传说在犹太人中间，直到今日。<br>
28:16 十一个门徒往加利利去，到了耶稣约定的山上。<br>
28:17 他们见了耶稣就拜他，然而还有人疑惑。<br>
28:18 耶稣进前来，对他们说：「天上地下所有的权柄都赐给我了。<br>
28:19 所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗。<br>
28:20 凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。」<br>

***

11 While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. 12 And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers 13 and said, "Tell people, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.' 14 And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." 15 So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day. 16 Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. 17 And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. 18 And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."
