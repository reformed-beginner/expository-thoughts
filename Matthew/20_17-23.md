# 二十章 

## 二 基督宣布自己即将被杀，真门徒身上混杂着无知与信心

太20:17-23

***

20:17 耶稣上耶路撒冷去的时候，在路上把十二个门徒带到一边，对他们说：<br>
20:18 「看哪，我们上耶路撒冷去，人子要被交给祭司长和文士。他们要定他死罪，<br>
20:19 又交给外邦人，将他戏弄，鞭打，钉在十字架上；第三日他要复活。」<br>
20:20 那时，西庇太儿子的母亲同她两个儿子上前来拜耶稣，求他一件事。<br>
20:21 耶稣说：「你要什么呢？」她说：「愿你叫我这两个儿子在你国里，一个坐在你右边，一个坐在你左边。」<br>
20:22 耶稣回答说：「你们不知道所求的是什么；我将要喝的杯，你们能喝吗？」他们说：「我们能。」<br>
20:23 耶稣说：「我所喝的杯，你们必要喝；只是坐在我的左右，不是我可以赐的，乃是我父为谁预备的，就赐给谁。」<br>

***

17 And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, 18 "See, we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death 19 and deliver him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day." 20 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and kneeling before him she asked him for something. 21 And he said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Say that these two sons of mine are to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom." 22 Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?" They said to him, "We are able." 23 He said to them, "You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
