## 四 邪恶园户的比喻

太21:33-46

***

21:33 「你们再听一个比喻：有个家主栽了一个葡萄园，周围圈上篱笆，里面挖了一个压酒池，盖了一座楼，租给园户，就往外国去了。<br>
21:34 收果子的时候近了，就打发仆人到园户那里去收果子。<br>
21:35 园户拿住仆人，打了一个，杀了一个，用石头打死一个。<br>
21:36 主人又打发别的仆人去，比先前更多；园户还是照样待他们。<br>
21:37 后来打发他的儿子到他们那里去，意思说：『他们必尊敬我的儿子。』<br>
21:38 不料，园户看见他儿子，就彼此说：『这是承受产业的。来吧，我们杀他，占他的产业！』<br>
21:39 他们就拿住他，推出葡萄园外，杀了。<br>
21:40 园主来的时候要怎样处治这些园户呢？」<br>
21:41 他们说：「要下毒手除灭那些恶人，将葡萄园另租给那按着时候交果子的园户。」<br>
21:42 耶稣说：「经上写着：匠人所弃的石头已作了房角的头块石头。这是主所做的，在我们眼中看为希奇。这经你们没有念过吗？<br>
21:43 所以我告诉你们，神的国必从你们夺去，赐给那能结果子的百姓。<br>
21:44 谁掉在这石头上，必要跌碎；这石头掉在谁的身上，就要把谁砸得稀烂。」<br>
21:45 祭司长和法利赛人听见他的比喻，就看出他是指着他们说的。<br>
21:46 他们想要捉拿他，只是怕众人，因为众人以他为先知。<br>

33 "Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country. 34 When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit. 35 And the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. 36 Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them. 37 Finally he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' 38 But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.' 39 And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. 40 When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?" 41 They said to him, "He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons." 42 Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: "'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'? 43 Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits. 44 And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him." 45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them. 46 And although they were seeking to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet.
