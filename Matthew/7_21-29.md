# 七章 

## 三 认信却不去行的无用，建造房子的两种人

太7:21-29

***

7:21 「凡称呼我『主啊，主啊』的人不能都进天国；惟独遵行我天父旨意的人才能进去。<br>
7:22 当那日必有许多人对我说：『主啊，主啊，我们不是奉你的名传道，奉你的名赶鬼，奉你的名行许多异能吗？』<br>
7:23 我就明明地告诉他们说：『我从来不认识你们，你们这些作恶的人，离开我去吧！』」<br>
7:24 「所以，凡听见我这话就去行的，好比一个聪明人，把房子盖在磐石上；<br>
7:25 雨淋，水冲，风吹，撞着那房子，房子总不倒塌，因为根基立在磐石上。<br>
7:26 凡听见我这话不去行的，好比一个无知的人，把房子盖在沙土上；<br>
7:27 雨淋，水冲，风吹，撞着那房子，房子就倒塌了，并且倒塌得很大。」<br>
7:28 耶稣讲完了这些话，众人都希奇他的教训；<br>
7:29 因为他教训他们，正像有权柄的人，不像他们的文士。<br>

***

21 "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' 23 And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.' 24 "Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 26 And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it." 28 And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, 29 for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
