# 二十七章 

## 四 基督行医治的神迹

太27:45-56

***

27:45 从午正到申初，遍地都黑暗了。<br>
27:46 约在申初，耶稣大声喊着说：「以利！以利！拉马撒巴各大尼？」就是说：「我的神！我的神！为什么离弃我？」<br>
27:47 站在那里的人，有的听见就说：「这个人呼叫以利亚呢！」<br>
27:48 内中有一个人赶紧跑去，拿海绒蘸满了醋，绑在苇子上，送给他喝。<br>
27:49 其余的人说：「且等着，看以利亚来救他不来。」<br>
27:50 耶稣又大声喊叫，气就断了。<br>
27:51 忽然，殿里的幔子从上到下裂为两半，地也震动，磐石也崩裂，<br>
27:52 坟墓也开了，已睡圣徒的身体多有起来的。<br>
27:53 到耶稣复活以后，他们从坟墓里出来，进了圣城，向许多人显现。<br>
27:54 百夫长和一同看守耶稣的人看见地震并所经历的事，就极其害怕，说：「这真是神的儿子了！」<br>
27:55 有好些妇女在那里，远远地观看；她们是从加利利跟随耶稣来服事他的。<br>
27:56 内中有抹大拉的马利亚，又有雅各和约西的母亲马利亚，并有西庇太两个儿子的母亲。<br>

***

45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" 47 And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, "This man is calling Elijah." 48 And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. 49 But the others said, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him." 50 And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit. 51 And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split. 52 The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, 53 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. 54 When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!" 55 There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, 56 among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
