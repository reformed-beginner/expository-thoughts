## 二 五饼二鱼的神迹

太14:13-21

***

14:13 耶稣听见了，就上船从那里独自退到野地里去。众人听见，就从各城里步行跟随他。<br>
14:14 耶稣出来，见有许多的人，就怜悯他们，治好了他们的病人。<br>
14:15 天将晚的时候，门徒进前来，说：「这是野地，时候已经过了，请叫众人散开，他们好往村子里去，自己买吃的。」<br>
14:16 耶稣说：「不用他们去，你们给他们吃吧！」<br>
14:17 门徒说：「我们这里只有五个饼，两条鱼。」<br>
14:18 耶稣说：「拿过来给我。」<br>
14:19 于是吩咐众人坐在草地上，就拿着这五个饼，两条鱼，望着天祝福，擘开饼，递给门徒，门徒又递给众人。<br>
14:20 他们都吃，并且吃饱了，把剩下的零碎收拾起来，装满了十二个篮子。
14:21 吃的人，除了妇女孩子，约有五千。<br>

***

13 Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. 14 When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. 15 Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves." 16 But Jesus said, "They need not go away; you give them something to eat." 17 They said to him, "We have only five loaves here and two fish." 18 And he said, "Bring them here to me." 19 Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. 20 And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. 21 And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
