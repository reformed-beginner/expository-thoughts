## 一 大筵席的比喻

太22:1-14

***

22:1 耶稣又用比喻对他们说：<br>
22:2 「天国好比一个王为他儿子摆设娶亲的筵席，<br>
22:3 就打发仆人去，请那些被召的人来赴席，他们却不肯来。<br>
22:4 王又打发别的仆人，说：『你们告诉那被召的人，我的筵席已经预备好了，牛和肥畜已经宰了，各样都齐备，请你们来赴席。』<br>
22:5 那些人不理就走了；一个到自己田里去；一个做买卖去；<br>
22:6 其余的拿住仆人，凌辱他们，把他们杀了。<br>
22:7 王就大怒，发兵除灭那些凶手，烧毁他们的城。<br>
22:8 于是对仆人说：『喜筵已经齐备，只是所召的人不配。<br>
22:9 所以你们要往岔路口上去，凡遇见的，都召来赴席。』<br>
22:10 那些仆人就出去，到大路上，凡遇见的，不论善恶都召聚了来，筵席上就坐满了客。<br>
22:11 王进来观看宾客，见那里有一个没有穿礼服的，<br>
22:12 就对他说：『朋友，你到这里来怎么不穿礼服呢？』那人无言可答。<br>
22:13 于是王对使唤的人说：『捆起他的手脚来，把他丢在外边的黑暗里；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。』<br>
22:14 因为被召的人多，选上的人少。」<br>

1 And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, 2 "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, 3 and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. 4 Again he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.' 5 But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, 6 while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. 7 The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. 8 Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. 9 Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.' 10 And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests. 11 "But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. 12 And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?' And he was speechless. 13 Then the king said to the attendants, 'Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 14 For many are called, but few are chosen."
