## 二 法利赛人对纳税的提问

太22:15-22

***

22:15 当时，法利赛人出去商议，怎样就着耶稣的话陷害他，<br>
22:16 就打发他们的门徒同希律党的人去见耶稣，说：「夫子，我们知道你是诚实人，并且诚诚实实传神的道，什么人你都不徇情面，因为你不看人的外貌。<br>
22:17 请告诉我们，你的意见如何？纳税给凯撒可以不可以？」<br>
22:18 耶稣看出他们的恶意，就说：「假冒为善的人哪，为什么试探我？<br>
22:19 拿一个上税的钱给我看！」他们就拿一个银钱来给他。<br>
22:20 耶稣说：「这像和这号是谁的？」<br>
22:21 他们说：「是凯撒的。」耶稣说：「这样，凯撒的物当归给凯撒；神的物当归给神。」<br>
22:22 他们听见就希奇，离开他走了。<br>

***

15 Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words. 16 And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. 17 Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?" 18 But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, "Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? 19 Show me the coin for the tax." And they brought him a denarius. 20 And Jesus said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" 21 They said, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." 22 When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away.
