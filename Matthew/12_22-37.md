# 十二章 

## 三 基督仇敌的亵渎，明知故犯的罪，闲话

太12:22-37

***

12:22 当下，有人将一个被鬼附着、又瞎又哑的人带到耶稣那里，耶稣就医治他，甚至那哑巴又能说话，又能看见。<br>
12:23 众人都惊奇，说：「这不是大卫的子孙吗？」<br>
12:24 但法利赛人听见，就说：「这个人赶鬼，无非是靠着鬼王别西卜啊。」<br>
12:25 耶稣知道他们的意念，就对他们说：「凡一国自相纷争，就成为荒场；一城一家自相纷争，必站立不住；<br>
12:26 若撒但赶逐撒但，就是自相纷争，他的国怎能站得住呢？<br>
12:27 我若靠着别西卜赶鬼，你们的子弟赶鬼又靠着谁呢？这样，他们就要断定你们的是非。<br>
12:28 我若靠着神的灵赶鬼，这就是神的国临到你们了。<br>
12:29 人怎能进壮士家里，抢夺他的家具呢？除非先捆住那壮士，才可以抢夺他的家财。<br>
12:30 不与我相合的，就是敌我的；不同我收聚的，就是分散的。」<br>
12:31 所以我告诉你们：「人一切的罪和亵渎的话都可得赦免，惟独亵渎圣灵，总不得赦免。<br>
12:32 凡说话干犯人子的，还可得赦免；惟独说话干犯圣灵的，今世来世总不得赦免。」<br>
12:33 「你们或以为树好，果子也好；树坏，果子也坏；因为看果子就可以知道树。<br>
12:34 毒蛇的种类！你们既是恶人，怎能说出好话来呢？因为心里所充满的，口里就说出来。<br>
12:35 善人从他心里所存的善就发出善来；恶人从他心里所存的恶就发出恶来。<br>
12:36 我又告诉你们，凡人所说的闲话，当审判的日子，必要句句供出来；<br>
12:37 因为要凭你的话定你为义，也要凭你的话定你有罪。」<br>

***

22 Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw. 23 And all the people were amazed, and said, "Can this be the Son of David?" 24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons." 25 Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand. 26 And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? 27 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. 28 But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. 29 Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. 30 Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. 31 Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32 And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. 33 "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit. 34 You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. 35 The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. 36 I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, 37 for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."
