# 二十三章 

## 二 对文士与法利赛人提出的八项指控

太23:13-33

***

23:13 「你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们正当人前，把天国的门关了，自己不进去，正要进去的人，你们也不容他们进去。<br>
23:15 「你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们走遍洋海陆地，勾引一个人入教，既入了教，却使他作地狱之子，比你们还加倍。<br>
23:16 「你们这瞎眼领路的有祸了！你们说：『凡指着殿起誓的，这算不得什么；只是凡指着殿中金子起誓的，他就该谨守。』<br>
23:17 你们这无知瞎眼的人哪，什么是大的？是金子呢？还是叫金子成圣的殿呢？<br>
23:18 你们又说：『凡指着坛起誓的，这算不得什么；只是凡指着坛上礼物起誓的，他就该谨守。』<br>
23:19 你们这瞎眼的人哪，什么是大的？是礼物呢？还是叫礼物成圣的坛呢？<br>
23:20 所以，人指着坛起誓，就是指着坛和坛上一切所有的起誓；<br>
23:21 人指着殿起誓，就是指着殿和那住在殿里的起誓；<br>
23:22 人指着天起誓，就是指着神的宝座和那坐在上面的起誓。<br>
23:23 「你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们将薄荷、茴香、芹菜献上十分之一，那律法上更重的事，就是公义、怜悯、信实，反倒不行了。这更重的是你们当行的；那也是不可不行的。<br>
23:24 你们这瞎眼领路的，蠓虫你们就滤出来，骆驼你们倒吞下去。<br>
23:25 「你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们洗净杯盘的外面，里面却盛满了勒索和放荡。<br>
23:26 你这瞎眼的法利赛人，先洗净杯盘的里面，好叫外面也干净了。<br>
23:27 「你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们好像粉饰的坟墓，外面好看，里面却装满了死人的骨头和一切的污秽。<br>
23:28 你们也是如此，在人前，外面显出公义来，里面却装满了假善和不法的事。<br>
23:29 「你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们建造先知的坟，修饰义人的墓，说：<br>
23:30 『若是我们在我们祖宗的时候，必不和他们同流先知的血。』<br>
23:31 这就是你们自己证明是杀害先知者的子孙了。<br>
23:32 你们去充满你们祖宗的恶贯吧！<br>
23:33 你们这些蛇类、毒蛇之种啊，怎能逃脱地狱的刑罚呢？<br>

13 "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves. 16 "Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.' 17 You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? 18 And you say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.' 19 You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? 20 So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. 21 And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it.#rl 22 And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it. 23 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. 24 You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel! 25 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. 26 You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean. 27 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness. 28 So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. 29 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous, 30 saying, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' 31 Thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. 32 Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers. 33 You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell?
