## 一 葡萄园工人的比喻

太20:1-16

***

20:1 「因为天国好像家主清早去雇人进他的葡萄园做工，<br>
20:2 和工人讲定一天一钱银子，就打发他们进葡萄园去。<br>
20:3 约在巳初出去，看见市上还有闲站的人，<br>
20:4 就对他们说：『你们也进葡萄园去，所当给的，我必给你们。』他们也进去了。<br>
20:5 约在午正和申初又出去，也是这样行。<br>
20:6 约在酉初出去，看见还有人站在那里，就问他们说：『你们为什么整天在这里闲站呢？』<br>
20:7 他们说：『因为没有人雇我们。』他说：『你们也进葡萄园去。』<br>
20:8 到了晚上，园主对管事的说：『叫工人都来，给他们工钱，从后来的起，到先来的为止。<br>
20:9 约在酉初雇的人来了，各人得了一钱银子。<br>
20:10 及至那先雇的来了，他们以为必要多得；谁知也是各得一钱。<br>
20:11 他们得了，就埋怨家主说：<br>
20:12 『我们整天劳苦受热，那后来的只做了一小时，你竟叫他们和我们一样吗？』<br>
20:13 家主回答其中的一人说：『朋友，我不亏负你，你与我讲定的不是一钱银子吗？<br>
20:14 拿你的走吧！我给那后来的和给你一样，这是我愿意的。<br>
20:15 我的东西难道不可随我的意思用吗？因为我作好人，你就红了眼吗？』<br>
20:16 这样，那在后的，将要在前；在前的，将要在后了。」<br>

1 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. 2 After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. 3 And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, 4 and to them he said, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.' 5 So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. 6 And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?' 7 They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.' 8 And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.' 9 And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. 10 Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius. 11 And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house, 12 saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.' 13 But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? 14 Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you. 15 Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?' 16 So the last will be first, and the first last."
