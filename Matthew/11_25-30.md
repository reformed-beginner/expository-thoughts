# 十一章 

## 三 基督的伟大，福音所发出邀请的完全

太11:25-30

***

11:25 那时，耶稣说：「父啊，天地的主，我感谢你！因为你将这些事向聪明通达人就藏起来，向婴孩就显出来。<br>
11:26 父啊，是的，因为你的美意本是如此。<br>
11:27 一切所有的，都是我父交付我的；除了父，没有人知道子；除了子和子所愿意指示的，没有人知道父。<br>
11:28 凡劳苦担重担的人可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。<br>
11:29 我心里柔和谦卑，你们当负我的轭，学我的样式；这样，你们心里就必得享安息。<br>
11:30 因为我的轭是容易的，我的担子是轻省的。」<br>

***

25 At that time Jesus declared, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; 26 yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. 27 All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. 28 Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
