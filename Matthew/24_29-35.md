## 三 基督再临的描述

太24:29-35

***

24:29 「那些日子的灾难一过去，日头就变黑了，月亮也不放光，众星要从天上坠落，天势都要震动。<br>
24:30 那时，人子的兆头要显在天上，地上的万族都要哀哭。他们要看见人子，有能力，有大荣耀，驾着天上的云降临。<br>
24:31 他要差遣使者，用号筒的大声，将他的选民，从四方，从天这边到天那边，都招聚了来。」<br>
24:32 「你们可以从无花果树学个比方：当树枝发嫩长叶的时候，你们就知道夏天近了。<br>
24:33 这样，你们看见这一切的事，也该知道人子近了，正在门口了。<br>
24:34 我实在告诉你们，这世代还没有过去，这些事都要成就。<br>
24:35 天地要废去，我的话却不能废去。」<br>

29 "Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31 And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. 32 "From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. 33 So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. 34 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
