# 二十四章 

## 一 橄榄山上的预言，对耶路撒冷被毁、基督再来与世界末了的预言

太24:1-14

***

24:1 耶稣出了圣殿，正走的时候，门徒进前来，把殿宇指给他看。<br>
24:2 耶稣对他们说：「你们不是看见这殿宇吗？我实在告诉你们，将来在这里没有一块石头留在石头上，不被拆毁了。」<br>
24:3 耶稣在橄榄山上坐着，门徒暗暗地来说：「请告诉我们，什么时候有这些事？你降临和世界的末了有什么预兆呢？」<br>
24:4 耶稣回答说：「你们要谨慎，免得有人迷惑你们。<br>
24:5 因为将来有好些人冒我的名来，说：『我是基督』，并且要迷惑许多人。<br>
24:6 你们也要听见打仗和打仗的风声，总不要惊慌；因为这些事是必须有的，只是末期还没有到。<br>
24:7 民要攻打民，国要攻打国；多处必有饥荒、地震。<br>
24:8 这都是灾难的起头。<br>
24:9 那时，人要把你们陷在患难里，也要杀害你们；你们又要为我的名被万民恨恶。<br>
24:10 那时，必有许多人跌倒，也要彼此陷害，彼此恨恶；<br>
24:11 且有好些假先知起来，迷惑多人。<br>
24:12 只因不法的事增多，许多人的爱心才渐渐冷淡了。<br>
24:13 惟有忍耐到底的，必然得救。<br>
24:14 这天国的福音要传遍天下，对万民作见证，然后末期才来到。」<br>

1 Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple. 2 But he answered them, "You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down." 3 As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age?" 4 And Jesus answered them, "See that no one leads you astray. 5 For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will lead many astray. 6 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are but the beginning of the birth pains. 9 "Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. 10 And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. 11 And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. 12 And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. 13 But the one who endures to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
