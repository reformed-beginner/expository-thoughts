# 二十六章 

## 四 园中极大的痛苦

太26:36-46

***

26:36 耶稣同门徒来到一个地方，名叫客西马尼，就对他们说：「你们坐在这里，等我到那边去祷告。」<br>
26:37 于是带着彼得和西庇太的两个儿子同去，就忧愁起来，极其难过，<br>
26:38 便对他们说：「我心里甚是忧伤，几乎要死；你们在这里等候，和我一同警醒。」<br>
26:39 他就稍往前走，俯伏在地，祷告说：「我父啊，倘若可行，求你叫这杯离开我。然而，不要照我的意思，只要照你的意思。」<br>
26:40 来到门徒那里，见他们睡着了，就对彼得说：「怎么样？你们不能同我警醒片时吗？<br>
26:41 总要警醒祷告，免得入了迷惑。你们心灵固然愿意，肉体却软弱了。」<br>
26:42 第二次又去祷告说：「我父啊，这杯若不能离开我，必要我喝，就愿你的意旨成全。」<br>
26:43 又来，见他们睡着了，因为他们的眼睛困倦。<br>
26:44 耶稣又离开他们去了。第三次祷告，说的话还是与先前一样。<br>
26:45 于是来到门徒那里，对他们说：「现在你们仍然睡觉安歇吧！时候到了，人子被卖在罪人手里了。<br>
26:46 起来！我们走吧。看哪，卖我的人近了！」<br>

***

36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go over there and pray." 37 And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. 38 Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me." 39 And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will." 40 And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, "So, could you not watch with me one hour? 41 Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." 42 Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done." 43 And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 44 So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. 45 Then he came to the disciples and said to them, "Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 46 Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."
