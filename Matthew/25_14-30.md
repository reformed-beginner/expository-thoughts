## 二 按才干受托的比喻

太25:14-30

***

25:14 「天国又好比一个人要往外国去，就叫了仆人来，把他的家业交给他们，<br>
25:15 按着各人的才干给他们银子：一个给了五千，一个给了二千，一个给了一千，就往外国去了。<br>
25:16 那领五千的随即拿去做买卖，另外赚了五千。<br>
25:17 那领二千的也照样另赚了二千。<br>
25:18 但那领一千的去掘开地，把主人的银子埋藏了。<br>
25:19 过了许久，那些仆人的主人来了，和他们算帐。<br>
25:20 那领五千银子的又带着那另外的五千来，说：『主啊，你交给我五千银子。请看，我又赚了五千。』<br>
25:21 主人说：『好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，你在不多的事上有忠心，我要把许多事派你管理；可以进来享受你主人的快乐。』<br>
25:22 那领二千的也来，说：『主啊，你交给我二千银子。请看，我又赚了二千。』<br>
25:23 主人说：『好，你这又良善又忠心的仆人，你在不多的事上有忠心，我要把许多事派你管理；可以进来享受你主人的快乐。』<br>
25:24 那领一千的也来，说：『主啊，我知道你是忍心的人，没有种的地方要收割，没有散的地方要聚敛，<br>
25:25 我就害怕，去把你的一千银子埋藏在地里。请看，你的原银子在这里。』<br>
25:26 主人回答说：『你这又恶又懒的仆人，你既知道我没有种的地方要收割，没有散的地方要聚敛，<br>
25:27 就当把我的银子放给兑换银钱的人，到我来的时候，可以连本带利收回。<br>
25:28 夺过他这一千来，给那有一万的。<br>
25:29 因为凡有的，还要加给他，叫他有余；没有的，连他所有的也要夺过来。<br>
25:30 把这无用的仆人丢在外面黑暗里；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。』」<br>

14 "For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. 15 To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. 16 He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. 17 So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. 18 But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. 19 Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 20 And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.' 21 His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.' 22 And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.' 23 His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.' 24 He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, 25 so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.' 26 But his master answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? 27 Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. 28 So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. 29 For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 30 And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
