# 二十二章 

## 四 律法师对最大诫命的提问，基督对他敌人的回答

太22:34-46

***

22:34 法利赛人听见耶稣堵住了撒都该人的口，他们就聚集。<br>
22:35 内中有一个人是律法师，要试探耶稣，就问他说：<br>
22:36 「夫子，律法上的诫命，哪一条是最大的呢？」<br>
22:37 耶稣对他说：「你要尽心、尽性、尽意爱主—你的神。<br>
22:38 这是诫命中的第一，且是最大的。<br>
22:39 其次也相仿，就是要爱人如己。<br>
22:40 这两条诫命是律法和先知一切道理的总纲。」<br>
22:41 法利赛人聚集的时候，耶稣问他们说：<br>
22:42 「论到基督，你们的意见如何？他是谁的子孙呢？」他们回答说：「是大卫的子孙。」<br>
22:43 耶稣说：「这样，大卫被圣灵感动，怎么还称他为主，说：<br>
22:44 主对我主说：你坐在我的右边，等我把你仇敌放在你的脚下。<br>
22:45 大卫既称他为主，他怎么又是大卫的子孙呢？」<br>
22:46 他们没有一个人能回答一言。从那日以后，也没有人敢再问他什么。<br>

34 But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. 35 And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. 36 "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?" 37 And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. 38 This is the great and first commandment. 39 And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. 40 On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets." 41 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, 42 saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David." 43 He said to them, "How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, 44 "'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet'? 45 If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?" 46 And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.
