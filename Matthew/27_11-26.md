# 二十七章 

## 二 基督在彼拉多面前被定罪

太27:11-26

***

27:11 耶稣站在巡抚面前；巡抚问他说：「你是犹太人的王吗？」耶稣说：「你说的是。」<br>
27:12 他被祭司长和长老控告的时候，什么都不回答。<br>
27:13 彼拉多就对他说：「他们作见证告你这么多的事，你没有听见吗？」<br>
27:14 耶稣仍不回答，连一句话也不说，以致巡抚甚觉希奇。<br>
27:15 巡抚有一个常例，每逢这节期，随众人所要的释放一个囚犯给他们。<br>
27:16 当时有一个出名的囚犯叫巴拉巴。<br>
27:17 众人聚集的时候，彼拉多就对他们说：「你们要我释放哪一个给你们？是巴拉巴呢？是称为基督的耶稣呢？」<br>
27:18 巡抚原知道他们是因为嫉妒才把他解了来。<br>
27:19 正坐堂的时候，他的夫人打发人来说：「这义人的事，你一点不可管，因为我今天在梦中为他受了许多的苦。」<br>
27:20 祭司长和长老挑唆众人，求释放巴拉巴，除灭耶稣。<br>
27:21 巡抚对众人说：「这两个人，你们要我释放哪一个给你们呢？」他们说：「巴拉巴。」<br>
27:22 彼拉多说：「这样，那称为基督的耶稣我怎么办他呢？」他们都说：「把他钉十字架！」<br>
27:23 巡抚说：「为什么呢？他做了什么恶事呢？」他们便极力地喊着说：「把他钉十字架！」<br>
27:24 彼拉多见说也无济于事，反要生乱，就拿水在众人面前洗手，说：「流这义人的血，罪不在我，你们承当吧。」<br>
27:25 众人都回答说：「他的血归到我们和我们的子孙身上。」<br>
27:26 于是彼拉多释放巴拉巴给他们，把耶稣鞭打了，交给人钉十字架。<br>

11 Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You have said so." 12 But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer. 13 Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?" 14 But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed. 15 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. 16 And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. 17 So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?" 18 For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. 19 Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream." 20 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. 21 The governor again said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas." 22 Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?"They all said, "Let him be crucified!" 23 And he said, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Let him be crucified!" 24 So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood;see to it yourselves." 25 And all the people answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!" 26 Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.
