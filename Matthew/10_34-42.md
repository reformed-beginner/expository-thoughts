# 十章 

## 四 对第一批基督徒传道人的鼓励

太10:34-42

***

10:34 「你们不要想我来是叫地上太平；我来并不是叫地上太平，乃是叫地上动刀兵。<br>
10:35 因为我来是叫人与父亲生疏，女儿与母亲生疏，媳妇与婆婆生疏。<br>
10:36 人的仇敌就是自己家里的人。<br>
10:37 「爱父母过于爱我的，不配作我的门徒；爱儿女过于爱我的，不配作我的门徒；<br>
10:38 不背着他的十字架跟从我的，也不配作我的门徒。<br>
10:39 得着生命的，将要失丧生命；为我失丧生命的，将要得着生命。」<br>
10:40 「人接待你们就是接待我；接待我就是接待那差我来的。<br>
10:41 人因为先知的名接待先知，必得先知所得的赏赐；人因为义人的名接待义人，必得义人所得的赏赐。<br>
10:42 无论何人，因为门徒的名，只把一杯凉水给这小子里的一个喝，我实在告诉你们，这人不能不得赏赐。」<br>

***

34 "Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. 35 For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. 36 And a person's enemies will be those of his own household. 37 Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 38 And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 39 Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. 40 "Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. 41 The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward. 42 And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward."
