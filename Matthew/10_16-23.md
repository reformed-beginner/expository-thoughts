## 二 对第一批基督徒传道人的训诲

太10:16-23

***

10:16 「我差你们去，如同羊进入狼群；所以你们要灵巧像蛇，驯良像鸽子。<br>
10:17 你们要防备人；因为他们要把你们交给公会，也要在会堂里鞭打你们，<br>
10:18 并且你们要为我的缘故被送到诸侯君王面前，对他们和外邦人作见证。<br>
10:19 你们被交的时候，不要思虑怎样说话，或说什么话。到那时候，必赐给你们当说的话；<br>
10:20 因为不是你们自己说的，乃是你们父的灵在你们里头说的。<br>
10:21 弟兄要把弟兄，父亲要把儿子，送到死地；儿女要与父母为敌，害死他们；<br>
10:22 并且你们要为我的名被众人恨恶。惟有忍耐到底的必然得救。<br>
10:23 有人在这城里逼迫你们，就逃到那城里去。我实在告诉你们，以色列的城邑，你们还没有走遍，人子就到了。<br>

***

16 "Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. 17 Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, 18 and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles. 19 When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. 20 For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. 21 Brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death, 22 and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. 23 When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next, for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
