# 二十一章 

## 二 基督把在圣殿里做买卖的人赶出去；不结果子的无花果树

太21:12-22

***

21:12耶稣进了神的殿，赶出殿里一切做买卖的人，推倒兑换银钱之人的桌子，和卖鸽子之人的凳子，<br>
21:13对他们说：「经上记着说：我的殿必称为祷告的殿，你们倒使它成为贼窝了。」<br>
21:14在殿里有瞎子、瘸子到耶稣跟前，他就治好了他们。<br>
21:15祭司长和文士看见耶稣所行的奇事，又见小孩子在殿里喊着说：「和散那归于大卫的子孙！」就甚恼怒，<br>
21:16对他说：「这些人所说的，你听见了吗？」耶稣说：「是的。经上说『你从婴孩和吃奶的口中完全了赞美』的话，你们没有念过吗？」<br>
21:17于是离开他们，出城到伯大尼去，在那里住宿。<br>
21:18早晨回城的时候，他饿了，<br>
21:19看见路旁有一棵无花果树，就走到跟前，在树上找不着什么，不过有叶子，就对树说：「从今以后，你永不结果子。」那无花果树就立刻枯干了。<br>
21:20门徒看见了，便希奇说：「无花果树怎么立刻枯干了呢？」<br>
21:21耶稣回答说：「我实在告诉你们，你们若有信心，不疑惑，不但能行无花果树上所行的事，就是对这座山说：『你挪开此地，投在海里！』也必成就。<br>
21:22你们祷告，无论求什么，只要信，就必得着。」<br>

12 And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. 13 He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you make it a den of robbers." 14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were indignant, 16 and they said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes; have you never read, "'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?" 17 And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there. 18 In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he became hungry. 19 And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves. And he said to it, "May no fruit ever come from you again!" And the fig tree withered at once. 20 When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree wither at once?" 21 And Jesus answered them, "Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen. 22 And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith."
