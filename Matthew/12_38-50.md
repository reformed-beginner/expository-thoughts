# 十二章 

## 四 不信的力量，不完全与不完整归正的危险，基督对门徒的爱

太12:38-50

***

12:38 当时，有几个文士和法利赛人对耶稣说：「夫子，我们愿意你显个神迹给我们看。」<br>
12:39 耶稣回答说：「一个邪恶淫乱的世代求看神迹，除了先知约拿的神迹以外，再没有神迹给他们看。<br>
12:40 约拿三日三夜在大鱼肚腹中，人子也要这样三日三夜在地里头。<br>
12:41 当审判的时候，尼尼微人要起来定这世代的罪，因为尼尼微人听了约拿所传的就悔改了。看哪，在这里有一人比约拿更大！<br>
12:42 当审判的时候，南方的女王要起来定这世代的罪；因为她从地极而来，要听所罗门的智慧话。看哪，在这里有一人比所罗门更大！」<br>
12:43 「污鬼离了人身，就在无水之地过来过去，寻求安歇之处，却寻不着。<br>
12:44 于是说：『我要回到我所出来的屋里去。』到了，就看见里面空闲，打扫干净，修饰好了，<br>
12:45 便去另带了七个比自己更恶的鬼来，都进去住在那里。那人末后的景况比先前更不好了。这邪恶的世代也要如此。」<br>
12:46 耶稣还对众人说话的时候，不料他母亲和他弟兄站在外边，要与他说话。<br>
12:47 有人告诉他说：「看哪，你母亲和你弟兄站在外边，要与你说话。」<br>
12:48 他却回答那人说：「谁是我的母亲？谁是我的弟兄？」<br>
12:49 就伸手指着门徒，说：「看哪，我的母亲，我的弟兄。<br>
12:50 凡遵行我天父旨意的人，就是我的弟兄姊妹和母亲了。」<br>

38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you." 39 But he answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40 For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 41 The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. 42 The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. 43 "When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none. 44 Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order. 45 Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation." 46 While he was still speaking to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him. 48 But he replied to the man who told him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?" 49 And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers! 50 For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
