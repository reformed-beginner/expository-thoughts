# 二十六章 

## 六 基督在犹太人公会面前

太26:57-68

***

26:57 拿耶稣的人把他带到大祭司该亚法那里去；文士和长老已经在那里聚会。<br>
26:58 彼得远远地跟着耶稣，直到大祭司的院子，进到里面，就和差役同坐，要看这事到底怎样。<br>
26:59 祭司长和全公会寻找假见证控告耶稣，要治死他。<br>
26:60 虽有好些人来作假见证，总得不着实据。末后有两个人前来，说：<br>
26:61 「这个人曾说：『我能拆毁神的殿，三日内又建造起来。』」<br>
26:62 大祭司就站起来，对耶稣说：「你什么都不回答吗？这些人作见证告你的是什么呢？」<br>
26:63 耶稣却不言语。大祭司对他说：「我指着永生神叫你起誓告诉我们，你是神的儿子基督不是？」<br>
26:64 耶稣对他说：「你说的是。然而，我告诉你们，后来你们要看见人子坐在那权能者的右边，驾着天上的云降临。」<br>
26:65 大祭司就撕开衣服，说：「他说了僭妄的话，我们何必再用见证人呢？这僭妄的话，现在你们都听见了。<br>
26:66 你们的意见如何？」他们回答说：「他是该死的。」<br>
26:67 他们就吐唾沫在他脸上，用拳头打他，也有用手掌打他的，说：<br>
26:68 「基督啊！你是先知，告诉我们打你的是谁？」

57 Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. 58 And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. 59 Now the chief priests and the whole Councilwere seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, 60 but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward 61 and said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.'" 62 And the high priest stood up and said, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?" 63 But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God." 64 Jesus said to him, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven." 65 Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. 66 What is your judgment?" They answered, "He deserves death." 67 Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him, 68 saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?"
