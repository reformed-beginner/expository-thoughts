# 十三章 

## 四 基督在自己家乡受到的待遇，不信的危险

太13:51-58

***

13:51 耶稣说：「这一切的话你们都明白了吗？」他们说：「我们明白了。」<br>
13:52 他说：「凡文士受教作天国的门徒，就像一个家主从他库里拿出新旧的东西来。」<br>
13:53 耶稣说完了这些比喻，就离开那里，<br>
13:54 来到自己的家乡，在会堂里教训人，甚至他们都希奇，说：「这人从哪里有这等智慧和异能呢？<br>
13:55 这不是木匠的儿子吗？他母亲不是叫马利亚吗？他弟兄们不是叫雅各、约西、西门、犹大吗？<br>
13:56 他妹妹们不是都在我们这里吗？这人从哪里有这一切的事呢？」<br>
13:57 他们就厌弃他。耶稣对他们说：「大凡先知，除了本地本家之外，没有不被人尊敬的。」<br>
13:58 耶稣因为他们不信，就在那里不多行异能了。<br>

***

51 "Have you understood all these things?" They said to him, "Yes." 52 And he said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old." 53 And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there, 54 and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? 55 Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? 56 And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?" 57 And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household." 58 And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.
