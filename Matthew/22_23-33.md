## 三 撒都该人对复活的提问

太22:23-33

***

22:23 撒都该人常说没有复活的事。那天，他们来问耶稣说：<br>
22:24 「夫子，摩西说：『人若死了，没有孩子，他兄弟当娶他的妻，为哥哥生子立后。』<br>
22:25 从前，在我们这里有弟兄七人，第一个娶了妻，死了，没有孩子，撇下妻子给兄弟。<br>
22:26 第二、第三，直到第七个，都是如此。<br>
22:27 末后，妇人也死了。<br>
22:28 这样，当复活的时候，她是七个人中哪一个的妻子呢？因为他们都娶过她。」<br>
22:29 耶稣回答说：「你们错了；因为不明白圣经，也不晓得神的大能。<br>
22:30 当复活的时候，人也不娶也不嫁，乃像天上的使者一样。<br>
22:31 论到死人复活，神在经上向你们所说的，你们没有念过吗？<br>
22:32 他说：『我是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。』神不是死人的神，乃是活人的神。」<br>
22:33 众人听见这话，就希奇他的教训。<br>

23 The same day Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, 24 saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.' 25 Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother. 26 So too the second and third, down to the seventh. 27 After them all, the woman died. 28 In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her." 29 But Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God. 30 For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. 31 And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God: 32 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living." 33 And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
