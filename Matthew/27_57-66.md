# 二十七章 

## 四 基督行医治的神迹

太27:57-66

***

27:57 到了晚上，有一个财主，名叫约瑟，是亚利马太来的，他也是耶稣的门徒。<br>
27:58 这人去见彼拉多，求耶稣的身体；彼拉多就吩咐给他。<br>
27:59 约瑟取了身体，用干净细麻布裹好，<br>
27:60 安放在自己的新坟墓里，就是他凿在磐石里的。他又把大石头滚到墓门口，就去了。<br>
27:61 有抹大拉的马利亚和那个马利亚在那里，对着坟墓坐着。<br>
27:62 次日，就是预备日的第二天，祭司长和法利赛人聚集来见彼拉多，说：<br>
27:63 「大人，我们记得那诱惑人的还活着的时候曾说：『三日后我要复活。』<br>
27:64 因此，请吩咐人将坟墓把守妥当，直到第三日，恐怕他的门徒来，把他偷了去，就告诉百姓说：『他从死里复活了。』这样，那后来的迷惑比先前的更利害了！」<br>
27:65 彼拉多说：「你们有看守的兵，去吧！尽你们所能的把守妥当。」<br>
27:66 他们就带着看守的兵同去，封了石头，将坟墓把守妥当。<br>

***

57 When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. 58 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. 59 And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud 60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. 61 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb. 62 The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate 63 and said, "Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise.' 64 Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last fraud will be worse than the first." 65 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can." 66 So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.
