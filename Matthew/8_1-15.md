## 一 基督行神迹医治长大麻风的、瘫痪的和害热病的人

太8:1-15

***

8:1 耶稣下了山，有许多人跟着他。<br>
8:2 有一个长大麻风的来拜他，说：「主若肯，必能叫我洁净了。」<br>
8:3 耶稣伸手摸他，说：「我肯，你洁净了吧！」他的大麻风立刻就洁净了。<br>
8:4 耶稣对他说：「你切不可告诉人，只要去把身体给祭司察看，献上摩西所吩咐的礼物，对众人作证据。」<br>
8:5 耶稣进了迦百农，有一个百夫长进前来，求他说：<br>
8:6 「主啊，我的仆人害瘫痪病，躺在家里，甚是疼苦。」<br>
8:7 耶稣说：「我去医治他。」<br>
8:8 百夫长回答说：「主啊，你到我舍下，我不敢当；只要你说一句话，我的仆人就必好了。<br>
8:9 因为我在人的权下，也有兵在我以下；对这个说『去！』他就去；对那个说『来！』他就来；对我的仆人说：『你做这事！』他就去做。」<br>
8:10 耶稣听见就希奇，对跟从的人说：「我实在告诉你们，这么大的信心，就是在以色列中，我也没有遇见过。<br>
8:11 我又告诉你们，从东从西，将有许多人来，在天国里与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各一同坐席；<br>
8:12 惟有本国的子民竟被赶到外边黑暗里去，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。」<br>
8:13 耶稣对百夫长说：「你回去吧！照你的信心，给你成全了。」那时，他的仆人就好了。<br>
8:14 耶稣到了彼得家里，见彼得的岳母害热病躺着。<br>
8:15 耶稣把她的手一摸，热就退了；她就起来服事耶稣。<br>

1 When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him. 2 And behold, a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean." 3 And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 4 And Jesus said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them." 5 When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, appealing to him, 6 "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering terribly." 7 And he said to him, "I will come and heal him." 8 But the centurion replied, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. 9 For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant,'Do this,' and he does it." 10 When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith. 11 I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, 12 while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 13 And to the centurion Jesus said, "Go; let it be done for you as you have believed." And the servant was healed at that very moment. 14 And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever. 15 He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and began to serve him.
