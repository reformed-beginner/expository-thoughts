## 二 麦子与稗子的比喻

太13:24-43

***

13:24 耶稣又设个比喻对他们说：「天国好像人撒好种在田里，<br>
13:25 及至人睡觉的时候，有仇敌来，将稗子撒在麦子里就走了。<br>
13:26 到长苗吐穗的时候，稗子也显出来。<br>
13:27 田主的仆人来告诉他说：『主啊，你不是撒好种在田里吗？从哪里来的稗子呢？』<br>
13:28 主人说：『这是仇敌做的。』仆人说：『你要我们去薅出来吗？』<br>
13:29 主人说：『不必，恐怕薅稗子，连麦子也拔出来。<br>
13:30 容这两样一齐长，等着收割。当收割的时候，我要对收割的人说，先将稗子薅出来，捆成捆，留着烧；惟有麦子要收在仓里。』」<br>
13:31 他又设个比喻对他们说：「天国好像一粒芥菜种，有人拿去种在田里。<br>
13:32 这原是百种里最小的，等到长起来，却比各样的菜都大，且成了树，天上的飞鸟来宿在它的枝上。」<br>
13:33 他又对他们讲个比喻说：「天国好像面酵，有妇人拿来，藏在三斗面里，直等全团都发起来。」<br>
13:34 这都是耶稣用比喻对众人说的话；若不用比喻，就不对他们说什么。<br>
13:35 这是要应验先知的话，说：我要开口用比喻，把创世以来所隐藏的事发明出来。<br>
13:36 当下，耶稣离开众人，进了房子。他的门徒进前来，说：「请把田间稗子的比喻讲给我们听。」<br>
13:37 他回答说：「那撒好种的就是人子；<br>
13:38 田地就是世界；好种就是天国之子；稗子就是那恶者之子；<br>
13:39 撒稗子的仇敌就是魔鬼；收割的时候就是世界的末了；收割的人就是天使。<br>
13:40 将稗子薅出来用火焚烧，世界的末了也要如此。<br>
13:41 人子要差遣使者，把一切叫人跌倒的和作恶的，从他国里挑出来，<br>
13:42 丢在火炉里；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。<br>
13:43 那时，义人在他们父的国里，要发出光来，像太阳一样。有耳可听的，就应当听！」<br>

24 He put another parable before them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field, 25 but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. 26 So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also. 27 And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, 'Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?' 28 He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' So the servants said to him, 'Then do you want us to go and gather them?' 29 But he said, 'No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'" 31 He put another parable before them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. 32 It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches." 33 He told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened." 34 All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable. 35 This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet:"I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world." 36 Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field." 37 He answered, "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. 38 The field is the world, and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, 39 and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels. 40 Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the close of the age. 41 The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, 42 and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.
