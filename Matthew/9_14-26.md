## 二 新酒新皮袋，管会堂的人的女儿得复活

太9:14-26

***

9:14 那时，约翰的门徒来见耶稣，说：「我们和法利赛人常常禁食，你的门徒倒不禁食，这是为什么呢？」<br>
9:15 耶稣对他们说：「新郎和陪伴之人同在的时候，陪伴之人岂能哀恸呢？但日子将到，新郎要离开他们，那时候他们就要禁食。<br>
9:16 没有人把新布补在旧衣服上；因为所补上的反带坏了那衣服，破的就更大了。<br>
9:17 也没有人把新酒装在旧皮袋里；若是这样，皮袋就裂开，酒漏出来，连皮袋也坏了。惟独把新酒装在新皮袋里，两样就都保全了。」<br>
9:18 耶稣说这话的时候，有一个管会堂的来拜他，说：「我女儿刚才死了，求你去按手在她身上，她就必活了。」<br>
9:19 耶稣便起来跟着他去；门徒也跟了去。<br>
9:20 有一个女人，患了十二年的血漏，来到耶稣背后，摸他的衣裳繸子；<br>
9:21 因为她心里说：「我只摸他的衣裳，就必痊愈。」<br>
9:22 耶稣转过来，看见她，就说：「女儿，放心！你的信救了你。」从那时候，女人就痊愈了。<br>
9:23 耶稣到了管会堂的家里，看见有吹手，又有许多人乱嚷，<br>
9:24 就说：「退去吧！这闺女不是死了，是睡着了。」他们就嗤笑他。<br>
9:25 众人既被撵出，耶稣就进去，拉着闺女的手，闺女便起来了。<br>
9:26 于是这风声传遍了那地方。<br>

***

14 Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" 15 And Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. 16 No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. 17 Neither is new wine put into old wineskins. If it is, the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved." 18 While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came in and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live." 19 And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples. 20 And behold, a woman who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, 21 for she said to herself, "If I only touch his garment, I will be made well." 22 Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well." And instantly the woman was made well. 23 And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, 24 he said, "Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping." And they laughed at him. 25 But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. 26 And the report of this went through all that district.
