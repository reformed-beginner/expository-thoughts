## 一 撒种的比喻

太13:1-23

***

13:1 当那一天，耶稣从房子里出来，坐在海边。<br>
13:2 有许多人到他那里聚集，他只得上船坐下，众人都站在岸上。<br>
13:3 他用比喻对他们讲许多道理，说：「有一个撒种的出去撒种；<br>
13:4 撒的时候，有落在路旁的，飞鸟来吃尽了；<br>
13:5 有落在土浅石头地上的，土既不深，发苗最快，<br>
13:6 日头出来一晒，因为没有根，就枯干了；<br>
13:7 有落在荆棘里的，荆棘长起来，把它挤住了；<br>
13:8 又有落在好土里的，就结实，有一百倍的，有六十倍的，有三十倍的。<br>
13:9 有耳可听的，就应当听！」<br>
13:10 门徒进前来，问耶稣说：「对众人讲话，为什么用比喻呢？」<br>
13:11 耶稣回答说：「因为天国的奥秘只叫你们知道，不叫他们知道。<br>
13:12 凡有的，还要加给他，叫他有余；凡没有的，连他所有的，也要夺去。<br>
13:13 所以我用比喻对他们讲，是因他们看也看不见，听也听不见，也不明白。<br>
13:14 在他们身上，正应了以赛亚的预言，说：你们听是要听见，却不明白；看是要看见，却不晓得；<br>
13:15 因为这百姓油蒙了心，耳朵发沉，眼睛闭着，恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白，回转过来，我就医治他们。<br>
13:16 「但你们的眼睛是有福的，因为看见了；你们的耳朵也是有福的，因为听见了。<br>
13:17 我实在告诉你们，从前有许多先知和义人要看你们所看的，却没有看见，要听你们所听的，却没有听见。」<br>
13:18 「所以，你们当听这撒种的比喻。<br>
13:19 凡听见天国道理不明白的，那恶者就来，把所撒在他心里的夺了去；这就是撒在路旁的了。<br>
13:20 撒在石头地上的，就是人听了道，当下欢喜领受，<br>
13:21 只因心里没有根，不过是暂时的，及至为道遭了患难，或是受了逼迫，立刻就跌倒了。<br>
13:22 撒在荆棘里的，就是人听了道，后来有世上的思虑、钱财的迷惑把道挤住了，不能结实。<br>
13:23 撒在好地上的，就是人听道明白了，后来结实，有一百倍的，有六十倍的，有三十倍的。」<br>

1 That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. 2 And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. 3 And he told them many things in parables, saying: "A sower went out to sow. 4 And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. 5 Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, 6 but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. 7 Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. 8 Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 9 He who has ears, let him hear." 10 Then the disciples came and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?" 11 And he answered them, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. 12 For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 13 This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. 14 Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: "'You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive. 15 For this people's heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.' 16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. 17 For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. 18 "Hear then the parable of the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. 20 As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, 21 yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. 22 As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. 23 As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty."
