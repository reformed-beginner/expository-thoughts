## 一 十个童女的比喻

太25:1-13

***

25:1 「那时，天国好比十个童女拿着灯出去迎接新郎。<br>
25:2 其中有五个是愚拙的，五个是聪明的。<br>
25:3 愚拙的拿着灯，却不预备油；<br>
25:4 聪明的拿着灯，又预备油在器皿里。<br>
25:5 新郎迟延的时候，她们都打盹，睡着了。<br>
25:6 半夜有人喊着说：『新郎来了，你们出来迎接他！』<br>
25:7 那些童女就都起来收拾灯。<br>
25:8 愚拙的对聪明的说：『请分点油给我们，因为我们的灯要灭了。』<br>
25:9 聪明的回答说：『恐怕不够你我用的；不如你们自己到卖油的那里去买吧。』<br>
25:10 她们去买的时候，新郎到了。那预备好了的，同他进去坐席，门就关了。<br>
25:11 其余的童女随后也来了，说：『主啊，主啊，给我们开门！』<br>
25:12 他却回答说：『我实在告诉你们，我不认识你们。』<br>
25:13 所以，你们要警醒；因为那日子，那时辰，你们不知道。」<br>

***

1 "Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. 2 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 3 For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, 4 but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. 5 As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. 6 But at midnight there was a cry, 'Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' 7 Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. 8 And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' 9 But the wise answered, saying, 'Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.' 10 And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. 11 Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, 'Lord, lord, open to us.' 12 But he answered, 'Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.' 13 Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.
