## 三 基督回答法利赛人关于权柄的质问；两个儿子

太21:23-32

***

21:23 耶稣进了殿，正教训人的时候，祭司长和民间的长老来问他说：「你仗着什么权柄做这些事？给你这权柄的是谁呢？」<br>
21:24 耶稣回答说：「我也要问你们一句话，你们若告诉我，我就告诉你们我仗着什么权柄做这些事。<br>
21:25 约翰的洗礼是从哪里来的？是从天上来的？是从人间来的呢？」他们彼此商议说：「我们若说『从天上来』，他必对我们说：『这样，你们为什么不信他呢？』<br>
21:26 若说『从人间来』，我们又怕百姓，因为他们都以约翰为先知。」<br>
21:27 于是回答耶稣说：「我们不知道。」耶稣说：「我也不告诉你们我仗着什么权柄做这些事。」<br>
21:28 又说：「一个人有两个儿子。他来对大儿子说：『我儿，你今天到葡萄园里去做工。』<br>
21:29 他回答说：『我不去』，以后自己懊悔，就去了。<br>
21:30 又来对小儿子也是这样说。他回答说：『父啊，我去』，他却不去。<br>
21:31 你们想，这两个儿子是哪一个遵行父命呢？」他们说：「大儿子。」耶稣说：「我实在告诉你们，税吏和娼妓倒比你们先进神的国。<br>
21:32 因为约翰遵着义路到你们这里来，你们却不信他；税吏和娼妓倒信他。你们看见了，后来还是不懊悔去信他。」<br>

23 And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, "By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?" 24 Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. 25 The baptism of John, from where did it come? From heaven or from man?" And they discussed it among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?' 26 But if we say, 'From man,'we are afraid of the crowd, for they all hold that John was a prophet." 27 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. 28 "What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.' 29 And he answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind and went. 30 And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, 'I go, sir,' but did not go. 31 Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.
