## 二 法利赛人的邪恶，对基督品格的描写鼓舞人心

太12:14-21

***

12:14 法利赛人出去，商议怎样可以除灭耶稣。<br>
12:15 耶稣知道了，就离开那里，有许多人跟着他。他把其中有病的人都治好了；<br>
12:16 又嘱咐他们，不要给他传名。<br>
12:17 这是要应验先知以赛亚的话，说：<br>
12:18 看哪！我的仆人，我所拣选、所亲爱、心里所喜悦的，我要将我的灵赐给他；他必将公理传给外邦。<br>
12:19 他不争竞，不喧嚷；街上也没有人听见他的声音。<br>
12:20 压伤的芦苇，他不折断；将残的灯火，他不吹灭；等他施行公理，叫公理得胜。<br>
12:21 外邦人都要仰望他的名。<br>

***

14 But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, how to destroy him. 15 Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all 16 and ordered them not to make him known. 17 This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: 18 "Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles. 19 He will not quarrel or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets; 20 a bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he brings justice to victory; 21 and in his name the Gentiles will hope."
