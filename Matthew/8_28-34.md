## 三 基督在格拉森为一个人赶鬼

太8:28-34

***

8:28 耶稣既渡到那边去，来到加大拉人的地方，就有两个被鬼附的人从坟茔里出来迎着他，极其凶猛，甚至没有人能从那条路上经过。<br>
8:29 他们喊着说：「神的儿子，我们与你有什么相干？时候还没有到，你就上这里来叫我们受苦吗？」<br>
8:30 离他们很远，有一大群猪吃食。<br>
8:31 鬼就央求耶稣，说：「若把我们赶出去，就打发我们进入猪群吧！」<br>
8:32 耶稣说：「去吧！」鬼就出来，进入猪群。全群忽然闯下山崖，投在海里淹死了。<br>
8:33 放猪的就逃跑进城，将这一切事和被鬼附的人所遭遇的都告诉人。<br>
8:34 合城的人都出来迎见耶稣，既见了就央求他离开他们的境界。<br>

***

28 And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way. 29 And behold, they cried out, "What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?" 30 Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them. 31 And the demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs." 32 And he said to them, "Go." So they came out and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters. 33 The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men. 34 And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
