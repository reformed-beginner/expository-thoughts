## 一 基督医治一个瘫子，呼召税吏马太

太9:1-13

***

9:1 耶稣上了船，渡过海，来到自己的城里。<br>
9:2 有人用褥子抬着一个瘫子到耶稣跟前来。耶稣见他们的信心，就对瘫子说：「小子，放心吧！你的罪赦了。」<br>
9:3 有几个文士心里说：「这个人说僭妄的话了。」<br>
9:4 耶稣知道他们的心意，就说：「你们为什么心里怀着恶念呢？<br>
9:5 或说『你的罪赦了』，或说『你起来行走』，哪一样容易呢？<br>
9:6 但要叫你们知道，人子在地上有赦罪的权柄」；就对瘫子说：「起来！拿你的褥子回家去吧。」<br>
9:7 那人就起来，回家去了。<br>
9:8 众人看见都惊奇，就归荣耀与神，因为他将这样的权柄赐给人。<br>
9:9 耶稣从那里往前走，看见一个人名叫马太，坐在税关上，就对他说：「你跟从我来。」他就起来跟从了耶稣。<br>
9:10 耶稣在屋里坐席的时候，有好些税吏和罪人来，与耶稣和他的门徒一同坐席。<br>
9:11 法利赛人看见，就对耶稣的门徒说：「你们的先生为什么和税吏并罪人一同吃饭呢？」<br>
9:12 耶稣听见，就说：「康健的人用不着医生，有病的人才用得着。<br>
9:13 经上说：『我喜爱怜恤，不喜爱祭祀。』这句话的意思，你们且去揣摩。我来本不是召义人，乃是召罪人。」<br>

***

1 And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city. 2 And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven." 3 And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming." 4 But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts? 5 For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? 6 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--he then said to the paralytic--"Rise, pick up your bed and go home." 7 And he rose and went home. 8 When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men. 9 As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him. 10 And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples. 11 And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?" 12 But when he heard it, he said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. 13 Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."
