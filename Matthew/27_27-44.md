# 二十七章 

## 四 基督行医治的神迹

太27:27-44

***

27:27 巡抚的兵就把耶稣带进衙门，叫全营的兵都聚集在他那里。<br>
27:28 他们给他脱了衣服，穿上一件朱红色袍子，<br>
27:29 用荆棘编做冠冕，戴在他头上，拿一根苇子放在他右手里，跪在他面前，戏弄他，说：「恭喜，犹太人的王啊！」<br>
27:30 又吐唾沫在他脸上，拿苇子打他的头。<br>
27:31 戏弄完了，就给他脱了袍子，仍穿上他自己的衣服，带他出去，要钉十字架。<br>
27:32 他们出来的时候，遇见一个古利奈人，名叫西门，就勉强他同去，好背着耶稣的十字架。<br>
27:33 到了一个地方名叫各各他，意思就是「髑髅地」。<br>
27:34 兵丁拿苦胆调和的酒给耶稣喝；他尝了，就不肯喝。<br>
27:35 他们既将他钉在十字架上，就拈阄分他的衣服，<br>
27:36 又坐在那里看守他。<br>
27:37 在他头以上安一个牌子，写着他的罪状，说：「这是犹太人的王耶稣。」<br>
27:38 当时，有两个强盗和他同钉十字架，一个在右边，一个在左边。<br>
27:39 从那里经过的人讥诮他，摇着头，说：<br>
27:40 「你这拆毁圣殿、三日又建造起来的，可以救自己吧！你如果是神的儿子，就从十字架上下来吧！」<br>
27:41 祭司长和文士并长老也是这样戏弄他，说：<br>
27:42 「他救了别人，不能救自己。他是以色列的王，现在可以从十字架上下来，我们就信他。<br>
27:43 他倚靠神，神若喜悦他，现在可以救他；因为他曾说：『我是神的儿子。』」<br>
27:44 那和他同钉的强盗也是这样地讥诮他。<br>

27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. 28 And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, 29 and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" 30 And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head. 31 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him. 32 As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross. 33 And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull), 34 they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. 35 And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. 36 Then they sat down and kept watch over him there. 37 And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews." 38 Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. 39 And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads 40 and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross." 41 So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, 42 "He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. 43 He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" 44 And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.
