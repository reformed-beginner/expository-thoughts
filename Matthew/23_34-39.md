# 二十三章 

## 二 对文士与法利赛人提出的八项指控

太23:34-39

***

23:34 所以我差遣先知和智慧人并文士到你们这里来，有的你们要杀害，要钉十字架；有的你们要在会堂里鞭打，从这城追逼到那城，<br>
23:35 叫世上所流义人的血都归到你们身上，从义人亚伯的血起，直到你们在殿和坛中间所杀的巴拉加的儿子撒迦利亚的血为止。<br>
23:36 我实在告诉你们，这一切的罪都要归到这世代了。」<br>
23:37 「耶路撒冷啊，耶路撒冷啊，你常杀害先知，又用石头打死那奉差遣到你这里来的人。我多次愿意聚集你的儿女，好像母鸡把小鸡聚集在翅膀底下，只是你们不愿意。<br>
23:38 看哪，你们的家成为荒场留给你们。<br>
23:39 我告诉你们，从今以后，你们不得再见我，直等到你们说：『奉主名来的是应当称颂的。』」<br>

***

34 Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, 35 so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. 36 Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation. 37 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! 38 See, your house is left to you desolate. 39 For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"
