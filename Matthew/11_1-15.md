## 一 基督为施洗约翰作见证

太11:1-15

***

11:1耶稣吩咐完了十二个门徒，就离开那里，往各城去传道、教训人。<br>
11:2约翰在监里听见基督所做的事，就打发两个门徒去，<br>
11:3问他说：「那将要来的是你吗？还是我们等候别人呢？」<br>
11:4耶稣回答说：「你们去，把所听见、所看见的事告诉约翰。<br>
11:5就是瞎子看见，瘸子行走，长大麻风的洁净，聋子听见，死人复活，穷人有福音传给他们。<br>
11:6凡不因我跌倒的就有福了！」<br>
11:7他们走的时候，耶稣就对众人讲论约翰说：「你们从前出到旷野是要看什么呢？要看风吹动的芦苇吗？<br>
11:8你们出去到底是要看什么？要看穿细软衣服的人吗？那穿细软衣服的人是在王宫里。<br>
11:9你们出去究竟是为什么？是要看先知吗？我告诉你们，是的，他比先知大多了。<br>
11:10经上记着说：『我要差遣我的使者在你前面预备道路』，所说的就是这个人。<br>
11:11我实在告诉你们，凡妇人所生的，没有一个兴起来大过施洗约翰的；然而天国里最小的比他还大。<br>
11:12从施洗约翰的时候到如今，天国是努力进入的，努力的人就得着了。<br>
11:13因为众先知和律法说预言，到约翰为止。<br>
11:14你们若肯领受，这人就是那应当来的以利亚。<br>
11:15有耳可听的，就应当听！<br>

***

1 When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities. 2 Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples 3 and said to him, "Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?" 4 And Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see: 5 the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. 6 And blessed is the one who is not offended by me." 7 As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 8 What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. 9 What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. 10 This is he of whom it is written, "'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.' 11 Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 12 From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. 13 For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, 14 and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. 15 He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
