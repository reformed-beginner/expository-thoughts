## 二 基督智慧地看待口头认信的人，平息湖面风浪

太8:16-27

***

8:16 到了晚上，有人带着许多被鬼附的来到耶稣跟前，他只用一句话就把鬼都赶出去，并且治好了一切有病的人。<br>
8:17 这是要应验先知以赛亚的话，说：他代替我们的软弱，担当我们的疾病。<br>
8:18 耶稣见许多人围着他，就吩咐渡到那边去。<br>
8:19 有一个文士来，对他说：「夫子，你无论往哪里去，我要跟从你。」<br>
8:20 耶稣说：「狐狸有洞，天空的飞鸟有窝，人子却没有枕头的地方。」<br>
8:21 又有一个门徒对耶稣说：「主啊，容我先回去埋葬我的父亲。」<br>
8:22 耶稣说：「任凭死人埋葬他们的死人；你跟从我吧！」<br>
8:23 耶稣上了船，门徒跟着他。<br>
8:24 海里忽然起了暴风，甚至船被波浪掩盖；耶稣却睡着了。<br>
8:25 门徒来叫醒了他，说：「主啊，救我们，我们丧命啦！」<br>
8:26 耶稣说：「你们这小信的人哪，为什么胆怯呢？」于是起来，斥责风和海，风和海就大大地平静了。<br>
8:27 众人希奇，说：「这是怎样的人？连风和海也听从他了！」<br>

***

16 That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick. 17 This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: "He took our illnesses and bore our diseases." 18 Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side. 19 And a scribe came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." 20 And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head." 21 Another of the disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father." 22 And Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead." 23 And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. 24 And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep. 25 And they went and woke him, saying, "Save us, Lord; we are perishing." 26 And he said to them, "Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. 27 And the men marveled, saying, "What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?"
