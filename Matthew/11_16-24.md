# 十一章 

## 二 揭露不信之人的无理，不使用光的危险

太11:16-24

***

11:16 我可用什么比这世代呢？好像孩童坐在街市上招呼同伴，说：<br>
11:17 我们向你们吹笛，你们不跳舞；我们向你们举哀，你们不捶胸。<br>
11:18 约翰来了，也不吃也不喝，人就说他是被鬼附着的；<br>
11:19 人子来了，也吃也喝，人又说他是贪食好酒的人，是税吏和罪人的朋友。但智慧之子总以智慧为是。」<br>
11:20 耶稣在诸城中行了许多异能，那些城的人终不悔改，就在那时候责备他们，说：<br>
11:21 「哥拉汛哪，你有祸了！伯赛大啊，你有祸了！因为在你们中间所行的异能，若行在泰尔、西顿，他们早已披麻蒙灰悔改了。<br>
11:22 但我告诉你们，当审判的日子，泰尔、西顿所受的，比你们还容易受呢！<br>
11:23 迦百农啊，你已经升到天上，将来必坠落阴间；因为在你那里所行的异能，若行在所多玛，它还可以存到今日。<br>
11:24 但我告诉你们，当审判的日子，所多玛所受的，比你还容易受呢！」<br>

16 "But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates, 17 "'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.' 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' 19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds." 20 Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent. 21 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 22 But I tell you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. 23 And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. 24 But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you."
