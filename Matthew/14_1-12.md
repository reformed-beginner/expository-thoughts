## 一 施洗约翰殉道

太14:1-12

***

14:1 那时，分封的王希律听见耶稣的名声，<br>
14:2 就对臣仆说：「这是施洗的约翰从死里复活，所以这些异能从他里面发出来。」<br>
14:3 起先，希律为他兄弟腓力的妻子希罗底的缘故，把约翰拿住，锁在监里。<br>
14:4 因为约翰曾对他说：「你娶这妇人是不合理的。」<br>
14:5 希律就想要杀他，只是怕百姓，因为他们以约翰为先知。<br>
14:6 到了希律的生日，希罗底的女儿在众人面前跳舞，使希律欢喜。<br>
14:7 希律就起誓，应许随她所求的给她。<br>
14:8 女儿被母亲所使，就说：「请把施洗约翰的头放在盘子里，拿来给我。」<br>
14:9 王便忧愁，但因他所起的誓，又因同席的人，就吩咐给她；<br>
14:10 于是打发人去，在监里斩了约翰，<br>
14:11 把头放在盘子里，拿来给了女子；女子拿去给她母亲。<br>
14:12 约翰的门徒来，把尸首领去埋葬了，就去告诉耶稣。<br>

***

1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, 2 and he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him." 3 For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, 4 because John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her." 5 And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. 6 But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, 7 so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. 8 Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter." 9 And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. 10 He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, 11 and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. 12 And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.
