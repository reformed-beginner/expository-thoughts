## 三 财宝、珠子与网的比喻

太13:44-50

***

13:44 「天国好像宝贝藏在地里，人遇见了就把它藏起来，欢欢喜喜地去变卖一切所有的，买这块地。<br>
13:45 天国又好像买卖人寻找好珠子，<br>
13:46 遇见一颗重价的珠子，就去变卖他一切所有的，买了这颗珠子。<br>
13:47 天国又好像网撒在海里，聚拢各样水族，<br>
13:48 网既满了，人就拉上岸来，坐下，拣好的收在器具里，将不好的丢弃了。<br>
13:49 世界的末了也要这样。天使要出来，从义人中把恶人分别出来，<br>
13:50 丢在火炉里；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。」<br>

***

44 "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. 45 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, 46 who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it. 47 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. 48 When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. 49 So it will be at the close of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous 50 and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
