## 三 两个瞎子得医治，基督怜悯众人，门徒的本分

太9:27-38

***

9:27 耶稣从那里往前走，有两个瞎子跟着他，喊叫说：「大卫的子孙，可怜我们吧！」<br>
9:28 耶稣进了房子，瞎子就来到他跟前。耶稣说：「你们信我能做这事吗？」他们说：「主啊，我们信。」<br>
9:29 耶稣就摸他们的眼睛，说：「照着你们的信给你们成全了吧。」<br>
9:30 他们的眼睛就开了。耶稣切切地嘱咐他们说：「你们要小心，不可叫人知道。」<br>
9:31 他们出去，竟把他的名声传遍了那地方。<br>
9:32 他们出去的时候，有人将鬼所附的一个哑巴带到耶稣跟前来。<br>
9:33 鬼被赶出去，哑巴就说出话来。众人都希奇，说：「在以色列中，从来没有见过这样的事。」<br>
9:34 法利赛人却说：「他是靠着鬼王赶鬼。」<br>
9:35 耶稣走遍各城各乡，在会堂里教训人，宣讲天国的福音，又医治各样的病症。<br>
9:36 他看见许多的人，就怜悯他们；因为他们困苦流离，如同羊没有牧人一般。<br>
9:37 于是对门徒说：「要收的庄稼多，做工的人少。<br>
9:38 所以，你们当求庄稼的主打发工人出去收他的庄稼。」<br>

***

27 And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, "Have mercy on us, Son of David." 28 When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord." 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith be it done to you." 30 And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows about it." 31 But they went away and spread his fame through all that district. 32 As they were going away, behold, a demon-oppressed man who was mute was brought to him. 33 And when the demon had been cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, "Never was anything like this seen in Israel." 34 But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of demons." 35 And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction. 36 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 37 Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; 38 therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."
