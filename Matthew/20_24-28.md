## 三 基督徒中有关伟大的标准

太20:24-28

***

20:24 那十个门徒听见，就恼怒他们弟兄二人。<br>
20:25 耶稣叫了他们来，说：「你们知道外邦人有君王为主治理他们，有大臣操权管束他们。<br>
20:26 只是在你们中间，不可这样；你们中间谁愿为大，就必作你们的用人；<br>
20:27 谁愿为首，就必作你们的仆人。<br>
20:28 正如人子来，不是要受人的服事，乃是要服事人，并且要舍命，作多人的赎价。」<br>

***

24 And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers. 25 But Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. 26 It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, 27 and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, 28 even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
