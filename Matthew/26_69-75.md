## 七 彼得不认主

太26:69-75

***

26:69 彼得在外面院子里坐着，有一个使女前来，说：「你素来也是同那加利利人耶稣一伙的。」<br>
26:70 彼得在众人面前却不承认，说：「我不知道你说的是什么！」<br>
26:71 既出去，到了门口，又有一个使女看见他，就对那里的人说：「这个人也是同拿撒勒人耶稣一伙的。」<br>
26:72 彼得又不承认，并且起誓说：「我不认得那个人。」<br>
26:73 过了不多的时候，旁边站着的人前来，对彼得说：「你真是他们一党的，你的口音把你露出来了。」<br>
26:74 彼得就发咒起誓地说：「我不认得那个人。」立时，鸡就叫了。<br>
26:75 彼得想起耶稣所说的话：「鸡叫以先，你要三次不认我。」他就出去痛哭。<br>

***

69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean." 70 But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you mean." 71 And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth." 72 And again he denied it with an oath: "I do not know the man." 73 After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you." 74 Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know the man." And immediately the rooster crowed. 75 And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
