# 十四章 

## 三 基督在海面行走

太14:22-36

***

14:22 耶稣随即催门徒上船，先渡到那边去，等他叫众人散开。<br>
14:23 散了众人以后，他就独自上山去祷告。到了晚上，只有他一人在那里。<br>
14:24 那时船在海中，因风不顺，被浪摇撼。<br>
14:25 夜里四更天，耶稣在海面上走，往门徒那里去。<br>
14:26 门徒看见他在海面上走，就惊慌了，说：「是个鬼怪！」便害怕，喊叫起来。<br>
14:27 耶稣连忙对他们说：「你们放心，是我，不要怕！」<br>
14:28 彼得说：「主，如果是你，请叫我从水面上走到你那里去。」<br>
14:29 耶稣说：「你来吧。」彼得就从船上下去，在水面上走，要到耶稣那里去；<br>
14:30 只因见风甚大，就害怕，将要沉下去，便喊着说：「主啊，救我！」<br>
14:31 耶稣赶紧伸手拉住他，说：「你这小信的人哪，为什么疑惑呢？」<br>
14:32 他们上了船，风就住了。<br>
14:33 在船上的人都拜他，说：「你真是神的儿子了。」<br>
14:34 他们过了海，来到革尼撒勒地方。<br>
14:35 那里的人一认出是耶稣，就打发人到周围地方去，把所有的病人带到他那里，<br>
14:36 只求耶稣准他们摸他的衣裳繸子；摸着的人就都好了。<br>

***

22 Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. 23 And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, 24 but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them. 25 And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. 26 But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, "It is a ghost!" and they cried out in fear. 27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid." 28 And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water." 29 He said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. 30 But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, "Lord, save me." 31 Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?" 32 And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. 33 And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God." 34 And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. 35 And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick 36 and implored him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.
