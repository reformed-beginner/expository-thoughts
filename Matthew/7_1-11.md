# 七章 

## 一 禁止论断

太7:1-11

***

7:1 「你们不要论断人，免得你们被论断。<br>
7:2 因为你们怎样论断人，也必怎样被论断；你们用什么量器量给人，也必用什么量器量给你们。<br>
7:3 为什么看见你弟兄眼中有刺，却不想自己眼中有梁木呢？<br>
7:4 你自己眼中有梁木，怎能对你弟兄说：『容我去掉你眼中的刺』呢？<br>
7:5 你这假冒为善的人！先去掉自己眼中的梁木，然后才能看得清楚，去掉你弟兄眼中的刺。<br>
7:6 不要把圣物给狗，也不要把你们的珍珠丢在猪前，恐怕它践踏了珍珠，转过来咬你们。」<br>
7:7 「你们祈求，就给你们；寻找，就寻见；叩门，就给你们开门。<br>
7:8 因为凡祈求的，就得着；寻找的，就寻见；叩门的，就给他开门。<br>
7:9 你们中间谁有儿子求饼，反给他石头呢？<br>
7:10 求鱼，反给他蛇呢？<br>
7:11 你们虽然不好，尚且知道拿好东西给儿女，何况你们在天上的父，岂不更把好东西给求他的人吗？<br>

***

1 "Judge not, that you be not judged. 2 For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. 3 Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? 4 Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is the log in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. 6 "Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you. 7 "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. 9 Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? 11 If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
