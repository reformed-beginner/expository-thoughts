## 三 对第一批基督徒传道人的警告

太10:24-33

***

10:24 学生不能高过先生；仆人不能高过主人。<br>
10:25 学生和先生一样，仆人和主人一样，也就罢了。人既骂家主是别西卜，何况他的家人呢？」<br>
10:26 「所以，不要怕他们；因为掩盖的事没有不露出来的，隐藏的事没有不被人知道的。<br>
10:27 我在暗中告诉你们的，你们要在明处说出来；你们耳中所听的，要在房上宣扬出来。<br>
10:28 那杀身体、不能杀灵魂的，不要怕他们；惟有能把身体和灵魂都灭在地狱里的，正要怕他。<br>
10:29 两个麻雀不是卖一分银子吗？若是你们的父不许，一个也不能掉在地上；<br>
10:30 就是你们的头发也都被数过了。<br>
10:31 所以，不要惧怕，你们比许多麻雀还贵重！」<br>
10:32 「凡在人面前认我的，我在我天上的父面前也必认他；<br>
10:33 凡在人面前不认我的，我在我天上的父面前也必不认他。」<br>

***

"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. 25 It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household. 26 "So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. 27 What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. 28 And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. 30 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. 32 So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, 33 but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.
