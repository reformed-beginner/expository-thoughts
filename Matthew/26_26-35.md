# 二十六章 

## 三 主的晚餐和第一批领受的人

太26:26-35

***

26:26 他们吃的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝福，就擘开，递给门徒，说：「你们拿着吃，这是我的身体」；<br>
26:27 又拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们，说：「你们都喝这个；<br>
26:28 因为这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。<br>
26:29 但我告诉你们，从今以后，我不再喝这葡萄汁，直到我在我父的国里同你们喝新的那日子。」<br>
26:30 他们唱了诗，就出来往橄榄山去。<br>
26:31 那时，耶稣对他们说：「今夜，你们为我的缘故都要跌倒。因为经上记着说：我要击打牧人，羊就分散了。<br>
26:32 但我复活以后，要在你们以先往加利利去。」<br>
26:33 彼得说：「众人虽然为你的缘故跌倒，我却永不跌倒。」<br>
26:34 耶稣说：「我实在告诉你，今夜鸡叫以先，你要三次不认我。」<br>
26:35 彼得说：「我就是必须和你同死，也总不能不认你。」众门徒都是这样说。<br>

26 Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body." 27 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, "Drink of it, all of you, 28 for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 29 I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom." 30 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 31 Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' 32 But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee." 33 Peter answered him, "Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away." 34 Jesus said to him, "Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." 35 Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!" And all the disciples said the same.
