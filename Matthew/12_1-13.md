## 一 澄清安息日的正确教训，清除犹太人的错误

太12:1-13

***

12:1 那时，耶稣在安息日从麦地经过。他的门徒饿了，就掐起麦穗来吃。<br>
12:2 法利赛人看见，就对耶稣说：「看哪，你的门徒做安息日不可做的事了！」<br>
12:3 耶稣对他们说：「经上记着大卫和跟从他的人饥饿之时所做的事，你们没有念过吗？<br>
12:4 他怎么进了神的殿，吃了陈设饼，这饼不是他和跟从他的人可以吃得，惟独祭司才可以吃。<br>
12:5 再者，律法上所记的，当安息日，祭司在殿里犯了安息日还是没有罪，你们没有念过吗？<br>
12:6 但我告诉你们，在这里有一人比殿更大。<br>
12:7 『我喜爱怜恤，不喜爱祭祀。』你们若明白这话的意思，就不将无罪的当作有罪的了。<br>
12:8 因为人子是安息日的主。」<br>
12:9 耶稣离开那地方，进了一个会堂。<br>
12:10 那里有一个人枯干了一只手。有人问耶稣说：「安息日治病可以不可以？」意思是要控告他。<br>
12:11 耶稣说：「你们中间谁有一只羊，当安息日掉在坑里，不把它抓住、拉上来呢？<br>
12:12 人比羊何等贵重呢！所以，在安息日做善事是可以的。」<br>
12:13 于是对那人说：「伸出手来！」他把手一伸，手就复了原，和那只手一样。<br>

***

1 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. 2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath." 3 He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: 4 how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? 5 Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? 6 I tell you, something greater than the temple is here. 7 And if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless. 8 For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath." 9 He went on from there and entered their synagogue. 10 And a man was there with a withered hand. And they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"--so that they might accuse him. 11 He said to them, "Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? 12 Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath." 13 Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other.
