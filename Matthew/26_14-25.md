# 二十六章 

## 二 那位假使徒，纠缠他的罪

太26:14-25

***

26:14 当下，十二门徒里有一个称为加略人犹大的，去见祭司长，<br>
26:15 说：「我把他交给你们，你们愿意给我多少钱？」他们就给了他三十块钱。<br>
26:16 从那时候，他就找机会要把耶稣交给他们。<br>
26:17 除酵节的第一天，门徒来问耶稣说：「你吃逾越节的筵席，要我们在哪里给你预备？」<br>
26:18 耶稣说：「你们进城去，到某人那里，对他说：『夫子说：我的时候快到了，我与门徒要在你家里守逾越节。』」<br>
26:19 门徒遵着耶稣所吩咐的就去预备了逾越节的筵席。<br>
26:20 到了晚上，耶稣和十二个门徒坐席。<br>
26:21 正吃的时候，耶稣说：「我实在告诉你们，你们中间有一个人要卖我了。」<br>
26:22 他们就甚忧愁，一个一个地问他说：「主，是我吗？」<br>
26:23 耶稣回答说：「同我蘸手在盘子里的，就是他要卖我。<br>
26:24 人子必要去世，正如经上指着他所写的；但卖人子的人有祸了！那人不生在世上倒好。」<br>
26:25 卖耶稣的犹大问他说：「拉比，是我吗？」耶稣说：「你说的是。」<br>

***

14 Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 15 and said, "What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. 16 And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him. 17 Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?" 18 He said, "Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'" 19 And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover. 20 When it was evening, he reclined at table with the twelve. 21 And as they were eating, he said, "Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me." 22 And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, "Is it I, Lord?" 23 He answered, "He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me. 24 The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born." 25 Judas, who would betray him, answered, "Is it I, Rabbi?" He said to him, "You have said so."
