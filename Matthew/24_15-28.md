# 二十四章 

## 二 继续预言，对耶路撒冷第一次和第二次围城苦况的预言

太24:15-28

***

24:15 「你们看见先知但以理所说的『那行毁坏可憎的』站在圣地（读这经的人须要会意）。<br>
24:16 那时，在犹太的，应当逃到山上；<br>
24:17 在房上的，不要下来拿家里的东西；<br>
24:18 在田里的，也不要回去取衣裳。<br>
24:19 当那些日子，怀孕的和奶孩子的有祸了。<br>
24:20 你们应当祈求，叫你们逃走的时候，不遇见冬天或是安息日。<br>
24:21 因为那时必有大灾难，从世界的起头直到如今，没有这样的灾难，后来也必没有。<br>
24:22 若不减少那日子，凡有血气的总没有一个得救的；只是为选民，那日子必减少了。<br>
24:23 那时，若有人对你们说：『基督在这里』，或说：『基督在那里』，你们不要信！<br>
24:24 因为假基督、假先知将要起来，显大神迹、大奇事，倘若能行，连选民也就迷惑了。<br>
24:25 看哪，我预先告诉你们了。<br>
24:26 若有人对你们说：『看哪，基督在旷野里』，你们不要出去！或说：『看哪，基督在内屋中』，你们不要信！<br>
24:27 闪电从东边发出，直照到西边。人子降临也要这样。<br>
24:28 尸首在哪里，鹰也必聚在那里。」<br>

***

15 "So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), 16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17 Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, 18 and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. 19 And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! 20 Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. 22 And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. 23 Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it. 24 For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you beforehand. 26 So, if they say to you, 'Look, he is in the wilderness,' do not go out. If they say, 'Look, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. 27 For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28 Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.
