# 二十五章 

## 三 最后的审判

太25:31-46

***

25:31 「当人子在他荣耀里、同着众天使降临的时候，要坐在他荣耀的宝座上。<br>
25:32 万民都要聚集在他面前。他要把他们分别出来，好像牧羊的分别绵羊山羊一般，<br>
25:33 把绵羊安置在右边，山羊在左边。<br>
25:34 于是王要向那右边的说：『你们这蒙我父赐福的，可来承受那创世以来为你们所预备的国；<br>
25:35 因为我饿了，你们给我吃，渴了，你们给我喝；我作客旅，你们留我住；<br>
25:36 我赤身露体，你们给我穿；我病了，你们看顾我；我在监里，你们来看我。』<br>
25:37 义人就回答说：『主啊，我们什么时候见你饿了，给你吃，渴了，给你喝？<br>
25:38 什么时候见你作客旅，留你住，或是赤身露体，给你穿？<br>
25:39 又什么时候见你病了，或是在监里，来看你呢？』<br>
25:40 王要回答说：『我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既做在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是做在我身上了。』<br>
25:41 王又要向那左边的说：『你们这被咒诅的人，离开我！进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去！<br>
25:42 因为我饿了，你们不给我吃，渴了，你们不给我喝；<br>
25:43 我作客旅，你们不留我住；我赤身露体，你们不给我穿；我病了，我在监里，你们不来看顾我。』<br>
25:44 他们也要回答说：『主啊，我们什么时候见你饿了，或渴了，或作客旅，或赤身露体，或病了，或在监里，不伺候你呢？』<br>
25:45 王要回答说：『我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既不做在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是不做在我身上了。』<br>
25:46 这些人要往永刑里去；那些义人要往永生里去。」<br>

31 "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. 34 Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, 36 I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.' 37 Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? 38 And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? 39 And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?' 40 And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.' 41 "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.' 44 Then they also will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?' 45 Then he will answer them, saying, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.' 46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
