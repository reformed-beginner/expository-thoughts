## 四 基督行医治的神迹

太28:1-10

***

28:1 安息日将尽，七日的头一日，天快亮的时候，抹大拉的马利亚和那个马利亚来看坟墓。<br>
28:2 忽然，地大震动；因为有主的使者从天上下来，把石头滚开，坐在上面。<br>
28:3 他的相貌如同闪电，衣服洁白如雪。<br>
28:4 看守的人就因他吓得浑身乱战，甚至和死人一样。<br>
28:5 天使对妇女说：「不要害怕！我知道你们是寻找那钉十字架的耶稣。<br>
28:6 他不在这里，照他所说的，已经复活了。你们来看安放主的地方。<br>
28:7 快去告诉他的门徒，说他从死里复活了，并且在你们以先往加利利去，在那里你们要见他。看哪，我已经告诉你们了。」<br>
28:8 妇女们就急忙离开坟墓，又害怕，又大大地欢喜，跑去要报给他的门徒。<br>
28:9 忽然，耶稣遇见她们，说：「愿你们平安！」她们就上前抱住他的脚拜他。<br>
28:10 耶稣对她们说：「不要害怕！你们去告诉我的弟兄，叫他们往加利利去，在那里必见我。」<br>

***

1 Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. 2 And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. 4 And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. 5 But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. 6 He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you." 8 So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 And behold, Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. 10 Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me."
