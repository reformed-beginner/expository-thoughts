## 一 假冒为善的文士与法利赛人，遗传的危险

太15:1-9

***

15:1 那时，有法利赛人和文士从耶路撒冷来见耶稣，说：<br>
15:2 「你的门徒为什么犯古人的遗传呢？因为吃饭的时候，他们不洗手。」<br>
15:3 耶稣回答说：「你们为什么因着你们的遗传犯神的诫命呢？<br>
15:4 神说：『当孝敬父母』；又说：『咒骂父母的，必治死他。』<br>
15:5 你们倒说：『无论何人对父母说：我所当奉给你的已经作了供献，<br>
15:6 他就可以不孝敬父母。』这就是你们借着遗传，废了神的诫命。<br>
15:7 假冒为善的人哪，以赛亚指着你们说的预言是不错的。他说：<br>
15:8 这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我；<br>
15:9 他们将人的吩咐当作道理教导人，所以拜我也是枉然。」<br>

***

1 Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, 2 "Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat." 3 He answered them, "And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? 4 For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.' 5 But you say, 'If anyone tells his father or his mother, "What you would have gained from me is given to God," 6 he need not honor his father.' So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God. 7 You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said: 8 "'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; 9 in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'"
